# Consolidate: Mind Management 

Students today are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety due to a combination of academic and social pressures. This often leads to a lack of productivity and an increase in procrastination. To help address this issue, Consolidate is to consist of four key elements.

Mood tracker. Keeping track of our daily mood enables us to understand our emotions more effectively. We learn precisely which combinations of actions, events and people lead us to feel a certain way.

Sleep tracker. The vast majority of students fail to get a full eight hours of sleep. Most likely, this leads to an irregular sleep cycle that has been proven to be both physically and mentally damaging. Sleep tracking encourages a regular sleep schedule that encourages a better state of health.

Diary/Journal. Personal reflection enables us to organise ourselves and evaluate our surroundings. There are many other reasons for keeping a journal or diary, these include better self-awareness, reduced procrastination and improved memory.

Personality, depression and social anxiety tests. Personality tests may offer advice based on our interests and qualities. This helps us identify our strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, depression and social anxiety tests help to indicate our mental health. Knowing the state of our mental health is very important as it allows us to seek out the help we may need and live a better life.
